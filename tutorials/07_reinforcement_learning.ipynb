    "\n",
    "🐕 **Traditional AI (Prompting)**: You give the dog a command, and it does its best based on what it already knows. It's like asking a well-trained dog to \"sit\" - it knows the command, but might not be perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "🎓 **Reinforcement Learning**: You let the dog try different things, reward it when it does well, and it learns from experience. Over time, the dog gets better and better at the task.\n",

    "### Real-World Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine teaching a child to play chess:\n",

    "   - ❌ Limited by initial knowledge\n",
    "   - ❌ Can't improve through practice\n",

    "### The Two Ways to Make AI Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of AI agents like employees. There are two ways to get them to do work:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 1: Prompting (What We've Been Doing)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Like giving instructions to a new employee:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# You tell the AI what to do\n",
    "llm = get_chat_model('claude-3-5-sonnet')  # Uses Holistic AI Bedrock\n",
    "agent = create_react_agent(tools=[search], llm=llm)\n",
    "result = agent.invoke(\"Find info about quantum computing\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- You write clear instructions (prompts)\n",
    "- The AI follows those instructions\n",
    "- It uses its general knowledge\n",
    "- Works immediately, no training needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- ✅ Fast to set up (minutes)\n",
    "- ✅ No training needed\n",
    "- ✅ Works for many tasks\n",
    "- ✅ Easy to change instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- ❌ Limited by the AI's general knowledge\n",
    "- ❌ May fail on complex, specific tasks\n",
    "- ❌ Can't improve without new prompts\n",
    "- ❌ Not specialized for your specific needs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Example**: Like asking a general-purpose assistant to help with your specific workflow. They understand, but might not be perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method 2: RL Training (What We'll Learn)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Like training an employee through practice:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# You let the AI practice and learn\n",
    "trained_agent = art.TrainableModel(\n",
    "    base_model='unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct'\n",
    ")\n",
    "await trained_agent.train(trajectory_groups)  # Learn from experience\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "- The AI tries many different approaches\n",
    "- It gets feedback on what works (rewards)\n",
    "- It learns from successes and failures\n",
    "- It gets better over time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- ✅ Specialized for your specific task\n",
    "- ✅ More reliable and consistent\n",
    "- ✅ Better at complex, multi-step tasks\n",
    "- ✅ Can discover optimal strategies\n",
    "- ✅ Improves with more training\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- ⏱️ Takes time to train (hours)\n",
    "- 💻 Needs GPU resources\n",
    "- 📊 Requires training data/scenarios\n",
    "- 🔧 More complex setup\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Example**: Like training a specialist who practices your specific workflow until they become an expert.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Traditional Prompting:\n",
    "You → Instructions → AI → Response\n",
    "(One-time, based on general knowledge)\n",
    "\n",
    "RL Training:\n",
    "You → Scenarios → AI tries → Gets feedback → Learns → Tries again → Better!\n",
    "(Repeated practice, learns from experience)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Should You Use Each Method?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Traditional Prompting When:**\n",
    "- ✅ Task is simple and straightforward\n",
    "- ✅ You need results quickly\n",
    "- ✅ Task changes frequently\n",
    "- ✅ 70-80% success rate is acceptable\n",
    "- ✅ You don't have GPU resources\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use RL Training When:**\n",
    "- ✅ Task requires 90%+ success rate\n",
    "- ✅ Complex, multi-step interactions\n",
    "- ✅ Task is repetitive and well-defined\n",
    "- ✅ You have training scenarios or can generate them\n",
    "- ✅ You need specialized performance\n",
    "- ✅ You have GPU resources available\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional Prompting Works Well For:**\n",
    "- Answering general questions\n",
    "- Simple one-step tasks\n",
    "- Creative writing\n",
    "- Quick prototypes\n",
    "\n",
    "**RL Training Works Better For:**\n",
    "- Email management agents (learn your specific workflow)\n",
    "- Game-playing agents (learn strategies)\n",
    "- Customer support (learn to handle complex cases)\n",
    "- Research agents (learn to use tools effectively)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bottom Line\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompting** = Fast, general-purpose, good enough for many tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "**RL Training** = Slower, specialized, excellent for specific tasks\n",

    "- 👤 **The Trainer (Your Code)**: You define what the agent should learn\n",
    "- 🎯 **The Student (AI Agent)**: The AI that gets trained\n",
    "- 🏆 **The Scoreboard (RULER)**: Automatically judges how well the agent did\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Training Process (Step by Step)\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like training for a sport:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You provide scenarios** (like practice drills)\n",
    "   - \"Answer this question\"\n",
    "   - \"Solve this problem\"\n",
    "   - \"Complete this task\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The agent tries multiple times** (like practicing a move)\n",
    "   - Each attempt is called a \"rollout\"\n",
    "   - Agent tries different approaches\n",
    "   - Creates multiple solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **RULER judges the attempts** (like a coach scoring performance)\n",
    "   - Compares all attempts\n",
    "   - Ranks them from best to worst\n",
    "   - Assigns scores automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The agent learns** (like improving through practice)\n",
    "   - Sees what worked well\n",
    "   - Adjusts its strategy\n",
    "   - Gets better over time\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Repeat** (like training sessions)\n",

    "### Key Components Explained Simply\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trajectory** - A record of what the agent did\n",
    "   - Like a game replay showing all moves\n",
    "   - Contains: question, agent's response, reward score\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rollout Function** - How your agent tries the task\n",
    "   - Like a practice attempt\n",
    "   - Agent generates a response\n",
    "   - Records what happened\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Like a judge giving scores\n",
    "   - Compares multiple attempts\n",
    "   - Automatically assigns scores (0.0 to 1.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training Loop** - The learning process\n",
    "   - Collects many trajectories\n",
    "   - Scores them with RULER\n",

    "## Step 4.5: Key RL Concepts for Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into training, understand these critical concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Trajectory Diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters**: Multiple rollouts per scenario (`rollouts_per_group`) create diverse trajectories, allowing RULER to compare and rank them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **More rollouts** = Better comparison = More reliable rewards\n",
    "- **Recommended**: 4-8 rollouts per scenario\n",
    "- **Trade-off**: More rollouts = Slower training but better quality\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Good: Multiple diverse trajectories\n",
    "art.TrajectoryGroup(\n",
    "    rollout(model, scenario) for _ in range(8)  # 8 diverse attempts\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. RULER Reward Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**RULER (Reward Using LLM Evaluation and Ranking)** automatically scores trajectories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compares multiple trajectories for the same scenario\n",
    "- Uses a judge model (e.g., `claude-3-5-sonnet`, `gpt-5-mini`) to rank them\n",
    "- Assigns relative scores (0.0-1.0) based on quality\n",
    "- **No manual reward engineering needed!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices**:\n",
    "- Use `swallow_exceptions=True` for robust error handling\n",
    "- Choose a strong judge model (API models recommended)\n",
    "- Ensure judge model understands your task domain\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ruler_score_group(\n",
    "    group,\n",
    "    \"openai/gpt-5-mini\",  # Strong judge model\n",
    "    swallow_exceptions=True  # Handle errors gracefully\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Exploration vs Exploitation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploration**: Agent tries different approaches (high temperature, diverse rollouts)\n",
    "**Exploitation**: Agent uses learned knowledge (lower temperature, focused responses)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **During Training**: Balance exploration (to find good strategies) and exploitation (to refine them)\n",
    "- **Rollout Temperature**: Start higher (0.7-0.9) for exploration, lower (0.3-0.5) for exploitation\n",
    "- **Multiple Rollouts**: Natural exploration mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Training Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Techniques**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Delete Checkpoints**: Clear old checkpoints before training\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   await model.delete_checkpoints()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Learning Rate**: Start with 5e-5, adjust based on convergence\n",
    "   - Too high: Unstable training, loss spikes\n",
    "   - Too low: Slow convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training Steps**: Monitor for convergence\n",
    "   - Early stopping if rewards plateau\n",
    "   - Continue if rewards still improving\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Common Pitfalls & Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "| Problem | Cause | Solution |\n",
    "|---------|-------|----------|\n",
    "| **Reward Hacking** | Model finds shortcuts | Use diverse scenarios, check outputs manually |\n",
    "| **Low Rewards** | Poor judge model or scenarios | Use stronger judge, verify scenario quality |\n",
    "| **Training Slow** | Too many rollouts/scenarios | Reduce rollouts, use smaller model |\n",
    "| **No Improvement** | Learning rate too low/high | Tune learning rate, check reward distribution |\n",
    "| **GPU OOM** | Model too large | Use smaller model, reduce batch size |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Multi-Turn Interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "**For complex tasks**, allow multiple turns:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def rollout(scenario: dict) -> art.Trajectory:\n",
    "    trajectory = art.Trajectory(messages_and_choices=[...])\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Multi-turn loop\n",
    "    for turn in range(MAX_TURNS):\n",
    "        response = await client.chat.completions.create(...)\n",
    "        trajectory.add_assistant_message(response.content)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Check if task is complete\n",
    "        if task_complete(response):\n",
    "            break\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Add follow-up message\n",
    "        trajectory.add_user_message(\"Continue...\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return trajectory\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Tool Usage in RL\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training agents to use tools effectively**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Include tool calls in trajectories\n",
    "- RULER judges tool usage quality\n",
    "- Model learns when and how to use tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Agent learns to call search tool before answering questions\n",

    "   - Verify RULER scoring works correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Monitor Training**\n",
    "   - Watch reward scores improve over steps\n",
    "   - Check for reward hacking (model finds shortcuts)\n",

    "   - Monitor GPU memory usage\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterate Quickly**\n",

    "### Key Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Learning Rate**: 1e-5 to 5e-5 (start with 5e-5)\n",
    "  - Too high: Unstable, loss spikes\n",
    "  - Too low: Slow convergence\n",
    "  - Adjust based on reward improvement rate\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rollouts per Scenario**: 4-8 (more = better but slower)\n",
    "  - More rollouts = Better RULER comparison\n",
    "  - Trade-off: Quality vs Speed\n",
    "  - Start with 4, increase if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Steps**: 2-10 (depends on convergence)\n",
    "  - Monitor reward improvement\n",
    "  - Stop if rewards plateau\n",
    "  - Continue if still improving\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temperature**: 0.7-0.9 during training (exploration)\n",

    "- Verify scenarios are appropriate and clear\n",
    "- Check if judge model understands your task domain\n",

    "- Use smaller base model\n",
    "- Check GPU utilization (should be high)\n",
    "- Reduce number of scenarios per batch\n",

    "- Verify reward function (RULER) is working correctly\n",
    "- Check if scenarios are too diverse (may need more focused set)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reward Hacking**:\n",
    "- Model finds shortcuts instead of solving task\n",
    "- **Solution**: Add more diverse scenarios, manually check outputs\n",
    "- Use stronger judge model\n",
    "- Add explicit constraints in system prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPU Out of Memory**:\n",
    "- Use smaller model (1-3B instead of 7-14B)\n",
