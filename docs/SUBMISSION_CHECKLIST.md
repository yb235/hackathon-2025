## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Private GitHub repo (judges can't access)
❌ Missing setup instructions in README
❌ No `.env.example` file
❌ Code doesn't run (test it!)
❌ Poster exceeds size limits
❌ Wrong team member count (must be 3-5)
❌ Missing track selection

---

## 🧪 Test Before Submitting

**Try this in a fresh environment:**

```bash
# Clone your repo
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo>

# Follow YOUR OWN setup instructions
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Add test API keys

# Can it run?
```

If someone else can't run your code, judges might not be able to either.

**Must have:**

- Your solution approach
- Key results/metrics

**Keep it simple:**
- Large fonts (readable from 2 meters away)
